# Cascading failure

A **cascading failure** in a high-level design context refers to a scenario where the failure of one component in a system triggers a sequence of failures in other interconnected components, potentially leading to the widespread or complete failure of the entire system. This often occurs in systems that are highly interdependent or lack sufficient redundancy and failover mechanisms.

### Key Characteristics of Cascading Failures:
1. **Interdependence**: Components rely on each other, so the failure of one can propagate to others.
2. **Chain Reaction**: The failure spreads progressively, affecting multiple layers or areas.
3. **Amplification**: Initial small issues can escalate into major system outages if not mitigated.
4. **Lack of Containment**: Poor isolation or insufficient safeguards allows the failure to ripple through the system.

### Examples of Cascading Failures:
#### 1. **Electrical Grid**:
   - A power station fails, causing increased load on neighboring stations. This overloads them, leading to a regional or national blackout.
   
#### 2. **Distributed Systems**:
   - In a microservices architecture, one service becomes unresponsive, overwhelming other services dependent on it, eventually crashing the system.

#### 3. **Financial Systems**:
   - The default of a major financial institution can trigger liquidity shortages in others, leading to market crashes.

### How to Mitigate Cascading Failures:
1. **Redundancy**:
   - Implement backups and failover systems to ensure continuity.
   
2. **Circuit Breakers**:
   - Use circuit breaker patterns to isolate failing components and prevent overloading the system.
   
3. **Load Balancing**:
   - Distribute traffic or workload evenly to avoid bottlenecks.
   
4. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Design systems to reduce functionality instead of completely failing.
   
5. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Real-time monitoring can identify issues early before they propagate.
   
6. **Decoupling**:
   - Reduce interdependencies by designing loosely coupled systems.
   
7. **Chaos Engineering**:
   - Test system resilience by simulating failures to understand and address vulnerabilities.

By proactively identifying weak points in a system and implementing robust mitigation strategies, cascading failures can often be contained or avoided entirely.
